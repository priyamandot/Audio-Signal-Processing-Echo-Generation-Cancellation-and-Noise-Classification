##Abstract
This project delves into various aspects of audio signal processing, specifically focusing on echo creation, cancellation, and background noise classification. In the first part,an echo effect is generated for a given audio file using signal processing techniques. The resulting echo is designed to be audible yet natural, simulating acoustic environments. Adjustable parameters, such as delay time, allow customization of the echo effect.In the second part, an echo cancellation algorithm is implemented to remove non-uniform echoes from an audio signal.The algorithm effectively preserves the original, clean audio by identifying and modeling the non-uniform delays in the signal.
Various signal processing techniques and algorithms are explored,promoting experimentation and creativity.The third part shifts the focus to background noise classification in music recordings without removal. The objective is to accurately identify and categorize different types of noise,
such as fan, pressure cooker, water pump, and traffic. Utilizing signal processing methods, the algorithm provides a detailed classification report specifying the types of noises present in the
audio recording.This comprehensive project not only explores fundamental concepts in audio signal processing but also encourages experimentation and creativity in algorithm design and implementation.
