# Audio Signal Processing: Echo Generation, Cancellation, and Noise Classification

**Abstract:**
This project explores various aspects of audio signal processing, with a focus on echo creation, cancellation, and background noise classification. In the first part, an echo effect is generated for a given audio file using signal processing techniques, with adjustable parameters to customize the effect. The second part implements an echo cancellation algorithm to remove non-uniform echoes from an audio signal, preserving the original audio quality. Various signal processing techniques and algorithms are explored, promoting experimentation and creativity. In the third part, the focus shifts to background noise classification in music recordings without removal. The objective is to accurately identify and categorize different types of noise, such as fan, pressure cooker, water pump, and traffic, using signal processing methods. The project not only delves into fundamental concepts in audio signal processing but also encourages experimentation and creativity in algorithm design and implementation.
